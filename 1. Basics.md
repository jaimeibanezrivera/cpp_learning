### Programs
To make a program run, its source text has to be processed by a compiler, producing object files, these files are combined by a linker yielding an executable program.

An executable program is created for a specific hardware, this means it is not portable 


### Functions
A function cannot be called unless it has been declared.
Function declaration (needs):
1. Type of returned value
2. Name of the function
3. Number and types of arguments it takes
4. (Optional) Name of the arguments it takes

### Types, Variables and Arithmetic
The size of a type is implementation-defined (it can vary among different machines), if we want to use a specific type, we use values like uint32_t/

#### Arithmetic
All the different types of ++,== an do on 

#### Initialization 
Before an object can be used, it must be given a value. There are different ways to do so:
```cpp
double d1 = 2.3; //old c way of doing it
double d2 {2.3}; //cpp form
double d3 = {2.3}; // cpp form, the = is optional

complex<double> z = 1;
complex<double> z2 {d1,d2}
complex<double> z3 = {d1,d2}
```

In general is best to use the '{}' form, why?
``` cpp
int i = 8.34         // it saves it as 8
int i {8.34}.        // it gives you an error
```

Cuando usamos **auto**, solemos usar la forma '=', porque tampoco nos va a salvar hacer nada en '{}', pero el libro tb dice que si quieres mantener consistencia '{}' tambien se puede.
